# Responsive Web Design and Floats

## RWD
 **RWD** - Responsive web design; building websites for all users, whether on desktop or a mobile device, no matter the screen size. Responsive is similar to adaptive,  where an adaptive website can change based on preset factors and a responsive website can continually change to respond to the viewport size. 

### Flexible layouts
Layouts designed with percentage widths will adjust container sizes based on the total width of the viewport. Instead of setting widths of and margins to a certain pixel size, the following is coded to be responsive:

```
section,
aside {
  margin: 1.858736059%; /*  10px รท 538px = .018587361 */
}
section {
  float: left;
  width: 63.197026%;    /* 340px รท 538px = .63197026 */   
}
aside {
  float: right;
  width: 29.3680297%;  /* 158px รท 538px = .293680297 */
}
```

*It's good practice to set minimum and maximum widths.*

### Media Queries
**Media Queries** are best used incases where text can become too large or small and break the layout of the webpage. 

#### HTML
```
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" media="all and (max-width: 1024px)">
```

#### CSS
```
/* @media Rule */
@media all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}
```

*The example below selects all media types between 800 and 1024 pixels wide.*
```
@media all and (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1024px) {...}
```

# [Floats](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/)
 - Using `float:` in CSS allows elements to text wrap
 - Objects can be set to `:right` or `:left`
 - `clear:` is used to block anything from flowing on one or `both` sides of an element
 - `overflow: hidden` is used to cut off excess outside of a container, ensuring the flow displays correctly instead of pushing down what should be flowing to a side of an element
