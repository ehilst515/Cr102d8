#  jQuery and Pair Programming

## jQuery

**jQuery** makes doing certain JS tasks simple and quickly done.
- **Select Elements**; CSS-style selectors instead of using DOM queries
- **Perform tasks**; update the DOM tree, animate elements in and out of view and loop through a set of elements 
    - Selecting multiple elements will make the code loop through all of the elements
- **Handle events**; methods that allow to attach event listeners to selected elements
    - Content filters
    - Finding elements
    - Dimensioning and positioning
        - `.before()` or `.after()`, `.prepend()` or `.append()`
    - Effects and animation 
    - Events
        - Events are received as objects 
        - Different types of events
            - UI
            - Keyboard
            - Mouse
            - Form
            - Document
            - Browser
    - Attribute updates
        - `.attr()` or `.removeAttr()`
        - `.addClass` or `.removeClass()`
    - Getting and setting CSS properties 
- **CDN**; content delivery network used to serve static files and can be used to source the jQuery file
    - Offered by Google or Microsoft
    - Linked with `script` tags and best placed before the closing body tag


## Pair Programming
**Pair programming** is done when two coders are working on the same file and one person types, the *driver* and the other person dictates what to do, the *navigator*. It helps cement coding knowledge by forcing certain challenges that improve learning.

### Benefits 
- Better code written, less time debugging
- More focus on the task at hand 
- Learning from other coders and learning from teaching
- Practice social skills, coding job interview elements and on-boarding techniques
