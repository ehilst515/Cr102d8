# Refactoring and Functional Programming

## [Refactoring](https://dev.to/healeycodes/refactoring-javascript-for-performance-and-readability-with-examples-1hec) 

Having readable code is important. It helps productivity and working within a group. JavaScript should be refactored to be easily readable with how the code is structured, and with comments. Code should be able to be read like a sentence rather than condensed to save lines. 


## [Functional Programming](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa) 

- **Functional programming** is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

- **Pure functions** return the same results as long as the passed arguments are the same and does not cause side effects. Functions are treated as values and used as data.
    - Do not 
        - Read external files
        - Rely on random numbers
        - Use mutable variables
