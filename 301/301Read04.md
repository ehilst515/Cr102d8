# Responsive Web Design and Regular Expressions

## Responsive Web Design
**Responsive websites** can be built using a [CSS grid](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/common-responsive-layouts-with-css-grid-and-some-without-245a862f48df). 

CSS Tricks - [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) lists all the ways to code a grid:

```
.container {
  display: grid | inline-grid;
  grid-template-columns: [first] 40px [line2] 50px [line3] auto [col4-start] 50px [five] 40px [end];
  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25% [row1-end] 100px [third-line] auto [last-line];
}

.containerTwo {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 20px [col-start]); \\creates three 20px columns
}

.item {
  grid-column-start: col-start 2;
}

.container {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 50px 1fr 1fr; \\creates rows with even fractions of space with the second row being 50px wide
}

```

## Regular Expressions
**Regular Expressions** or regex, is a useful tool for extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern. This can be used in almost all programming languages with the same syntax. There are many different ways of searching text; anchors, quantifiers, or, character classes, flags, etc. The [regex tutorial article on Medium](https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285) lists many of the ways text can be searched.
