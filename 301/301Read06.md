**Node.JS** is a runtime that was built on Google's [V8](https://v8.dev/) engine, a WebAssembly engine that's written in [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/) and uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage packages. It has a built in console module and allows JavaScript to be ran on the server by managing tasks through loops. It can be used to create collaborative apps, as it allows files to be processed while they're still being uploaded.
