# Introductory HTML and JavaScript
## HTML
### Structure
Structure is important for displaying information in a way that's clear and easy for a user to quickly find. We want headers at the top of sections, navigation panels in common places, etc.
```
<header>
<h1>Top Header</h1>
<nav>
    <ul>
        <li> Navigation Link </li>
        <li> Navigation Link </li>
        <li> Navigation Link </li>
    </ul>
</header>
<body>
    <h2>1st Sub Header</h2>
    <p> 1st Content<p>
    <h2>2nd Sub Header</h2>
    <p> 2nd Content<p>
</body>
<footer>
    <address>
    Headquarters
    555 Address Lane
    </address>
</footer>
```

### Extra Markup
Extra markup in HTML includes:

**Document types**
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
**Comments** 
```
<!-- comments about what the code is or does goes here -->
```
**Element ID**
```
<p id="attributeName"> Text content with an element id. <p>
```
**Element Class**
```
<p class="attributeName"> Text content with an element class. <p>
```
**Block Elements**
```
<ul>
    <li>
    <li>
    <li>
</ul>
```
**Inline Elements**
```
<a></a>
<img>
```
**Grouping Elements: blocks or inline elements**
```
<div>
    <img>
    <p>Inline elements <span class="className"> targeted styled text</span></p>
<div>
```
**Meta**

*Meta information for webpage*


### HTML5 Layout
HTML5 reduces the use of `<div>` and uses more semantic text. Example:
```
<div class='header'>
</div>
<div class='article'>
</div>
```
vs
```
<header>
</header>
<article>
</article>
```
Here's the full list of semantic tags in HTML5: [W3 Schools - HTML5 Semantic Elements]( https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp).

### Process & Design
The first step in designing a website is to contemplate who will use it and how. This is called a use case, and should study:

- Target audience
- Key motivations and specific goals
- Key information needed
- How often the audience visits the website

Next, create a [site map](https://www.seobility.net/en/wiki/HTML_Sitemap#:~:text=An%20HTML%20sitemap%20is%20an,therefore%20visible%20to%20all%20visitors.) and [wireframes](https://www.codementor.io/@nicolesaidy/getting-started-with-wireframes-du107vuh7). Then consider the [visual elements of the website](https://www.jotform.com/blog/how-to-make-a-web-design-look-good/).

## JavaScript
A script is a series of instructions, similar to recipes, handbooks and manuals. It's best to first define the goal of a script, design the script using a flowchart, and then code each step. The following is used when writing code for scripts 

```
var object = 'property'
```

```
objectName.methodName()
```

```
obeject.method('parameter of method')
```

```
<script src="js/app.js"></script>
```
*The last example runs the script and is activated at the point of the loading page. It runs before the page is loaded if it's in the head, and last if it's below the footer.*
