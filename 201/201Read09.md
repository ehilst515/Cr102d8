# Debugging

When searching for errors in buggy code, consider:

  - **The order of operations:** what function needs which variable before it can run?

  - **Scope level:** a global scope `var` is outside of a function, function-level scope is inside

  - **Hoisting and execution:** The scope is prepared and elements are created, then the execution happens and values are assigned to variables, functions are referenced and statements are executed.

- **Error Objects:**
    - `error` - generic error
    - `SyntaxError` - Syntax has not been followed
    - `ReferenceError` - Tried to reference a variable that is not declared/ within scope
    - `TypeError` - An unexpected data type that cannot be coerced
    - `RangeError` - Numbers not in acceptable range
    - `EvalError` - `eval()` function not used correctly
- **Using the console:** Chrome has excellent developer tools, and the console can be used to call functions, see what values are assigned to variables, etc.
    - `console.log()` makes the console display whatever is within the `.log()` function. `.info`, `.warn()`, `.error()`, `.table()` are also available options
    - `console.group('Group Name) ... console.groupEnd()` groups together console messages as added with the above options
    - Console messages can be written on conditions
- **Handling exceptions:** Try, catch, finally, and throw can be used when its known code might fail
    - `try` - try to execute this code 
    - `catch` - if there is an exception, run this code
    - `finally` - code that always gets executed 
    - `throw`- create your own error
