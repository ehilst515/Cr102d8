# What Google Learned About Teams
[What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) is an interesting article about the ideal dynamics for a highly successful team. An internal researcher within Google found that there is no specific combination of people that make up a good team. What they instead found was that the groups norms and traditions were more important than the individuals' personalities. These were found to be the most important traits of a group:
 - The team knew their impact in the larger picture within the entire company; not having this reduces job satisfaction
 - Each team member spoke about the same amount during meetings; having one person or a smaller group dominate the conversation made others feel like they had things left unsaid
 - Everyone feels safe to make mistakes and to not be judged harshly for trying; emotional intelligence is important to recognize when other team members felt down or not included  

The comfort of everyone to take risks and have their fair share of speaking in the conversation is known as "[psychological safety](https://www.predictiveindex.com/blog/psychological-safety-in-the-workplace/)."
