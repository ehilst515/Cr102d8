# Local Storage
- Cookies are one way to store small amounts of local data. However, they:
    - Slow down web application with by transmitting the same data over and over
    - Are unencrypted
    - Limited to 4 KB of data

- Internet Explorer brought DHTML Behaviors, including `userData`, which allows 64 KB of storage per domain
    - Other companies found new ways of storage, but were limited in size and browser
    - `dojox.storage` was made to tie all storage solutions together

- HTML5 Storage: the current standard 
    - Allows web pages to store named key/value pairs locally and they persist after the user navigates away from the website
    - Does not send data to a remote server, like cookies
    - Uses the `localStorage` object as an associative array
    - Allows for event listeners for storage events
    - 5 megabytes of storage of strings, and no more
    - Functions can be used to call variables from storage, instead of re-writing hard-coded values
