# Growth Mindset
**The growth mindset** is the idea that staying opened minded and persistent will allow continual personal growth and ability. It requires avoiding fixed mindset habits, such as falling into distractions and avoiding challenges, roadblocks and criticism. Keeping a growth mindset allows these things to become learning opportunities, and gain inspiration by others who have overcome difficulties to become successful.
