# Computer Architecture and Logic
Watching [this series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-) has furthered my understanding of what a computer is. 

1. A computer can be described as something that:

    - Receive inputs
    - Store information
    - Process information
    - Create outputs

2. Binary, the 1's and 0's or True and False of software are stored using many wires that are either `ON` (1 or True) or `OFF` (0 or off). These wires are routed into different circuits that can be thought of as simple logic questions, such as `AND` or `NAND`, `NOT` or `NOR`, `OR` or `NOR`. The more circuits and wires, the more complex calculations and processing a computer can do.

3. A CPU has different parts that do specific things, such as adding and sending information to memory. The logic explained above is how software tells the CPU what to do.
