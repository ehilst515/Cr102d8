# Revisions and the Cloud
Git allows revision control. This allows collaboration with other people without overwriting their work. Edits can be done remotely and applied to files on the cloud later. This requires an ACP:

 - Add: tells git what changes to commit
 - Commit: commit changes the code 
 - Push: sends the code changes to GitHub

We first need to clone projects to copy whatâ€™s on GitHub onto a local computer, and link the project folder to the repo. This is done in the terminal.

Answer the true or false questions:

1. Changes are staged before they're moved from the working directory to the repository

- [ ] True 
- [ ] False

2. A message must be included when committing changes

- [ ] True 
- [ ] False

3. Changes can be made without pushing to the repo

- [ ] True 
- [ ] False
