# Images, Color, Text

## Images
In HTML, images are added with the self-closing `<img>` tag, which can contain: 
- source - where the image is located; either an internal folder or external HTML location
- alt text - provides text if the image cannot be seen; useful for webpage readers
- title - text that displays when a user hovers over the image
- height and width - defines the images dimensions as the image displays

`<figure>` and `<figcaption>` can be used to wrap an image and it's caption together. 

```
<figure>
    <img src="images/sample.jpg" alt="This is a sample image" title="Sample image" heigth="300px" width="500px">
    <br/>
    <figcaption> Above is a sample image. This is a sample of a caption.</figcaption>
</figure>
```
*This code can be written above a text element to be displayed as a block, or within a text element to be displayed among text*

Images can appear distorted or out of place if they don't match the color scheme, are saved in the wrong format or sized incorrectly. Make sure to crop images so that they display what's meant to be displayed, not less or more. Use the `.gif` format for flat animated images only.
