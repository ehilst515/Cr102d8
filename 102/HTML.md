# HTML and Web Page Structure
When considering how to build a website, understanding how people will use the website is very important. The first step in the process is to consider who will visit the site and how they will interact with it. 

## Things to consider about your visitors
- [ ] Key motivations: what brought them here?
- [ ] Specific goals: what do they want to do here?
- [ ] Key information: what do they need to know about being here? 
- [ ] Disabilities: how easy is it to navigate using accessibility software?

## Site Map
A site map can be made once the most important things about your visitors have been considered. Create a diagram to breakdown how your site will be navigated. Try using a website like [Moqups](https://moqups.com/)!

## Wireframe
Now create a barebones structured image to plan how the website will look without yet considering the presentation. Try using a website like [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/)
