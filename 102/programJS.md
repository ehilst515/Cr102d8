# Programming with JavaScript
### Defining JavaScript
JavaScript is a powerful language that allows webpages to be able to:

- **Access** the content of the page
- **Modify** the content of the page
- **Program** rules or instructions the browser can follow
- **React** to events triggered by the user or browser 

### Where to start
Creating a JavaScript code should start with creating a map of what you want the code to from the triggers to activate it to the reaction results desired. Break this down to three steps:

1. Define the goal
2. Design the script
3. Code each step 

*Having an overview of what needs to happen, then planning how to make it happen, and coding the script as the last step makes the coding process much easier.*

### Expressions and Operators
**Expressions**: results in a value; they can just assign a value to a variable, `var car = 'Elantra';`, or evaluate multiple values to result in a single value, `var calc = 3+2`. *The variable `car` is now the string `Elantra`, and `calc` is now `6`.*

**Operators**: allow resulting a single value from one or more values, including;

- Assignment operators
- Arithmetic operators
- String operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators

### Functions
**Functions** can wrap multiple lines of code into one package. The benefits of using functions are that it makes it easier to:

- Reduce chances of mistakes
- Reference to multiple times in one HTML code
- Read and understand what JavaScript code is doing
- Copy and paste into new code in the future

Parts of a function:

- **Keywords** used to declare a function
- **Function name** is the function's ID
- **Code block** is where the code running within the function lives
