# Operators and Loops
### Operators
##### *Result into a Boolean: `true` or`false`*

Operator | Operation | Example | Result
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------
`==` |is equal to | `4 = 3` | `False`
`!=` | is not equal to | `4 = 3` | `True`
`===` | strict equals to | `'4'=== 4` <br> `'4' === '4'`| `False` <br> `True`
`!==`| strict not equals to| `'4'=== 4` <br> `'4' === '4'`| `True` <br> `False`
`>` | greater than| `4 > 3`|  `True`
`<` | less than | `4 > 3` | `False`
`&&` | logical and | `((4>3)&&(4<5))`|`true`
`||` | logical or | `((4>3)||(4>100))`| `true`
`!`| logical not | `!(4>10)`| `true`

### Loops keep Looping
##### *Until rules are met for them to stop*

**Loops** check for logic, and repeat lines of code until certain rules are met. These are the different loops:

- `for`; used when an array is needed to store information
- `while`; used when calculations need to be repeated
