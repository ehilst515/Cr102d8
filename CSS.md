# Design web pages with CSS
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheet allows a coder to change the looks of HTML elements. Each element has an invisible box around it, and CSS can change the appearance of what's in the box. Each ancestor, child, and sibling within HTML code can be changed with different CSS rules. For example, we can change set the font color of a header, `<h1>`, differently from the paragraph, `<p1>` within the same body.
