# Growth Mindset
**The growth mindset** is the idea that staying *opened minded* and *persistent* will allow continual personal growth and ability. It requires avoiding fixed mindset habits, such as falling into distractions and avoiding challenges, roadblocks and criticism. Keeping a growth mindset allows these things to become learning opportunities, and gain inspiration by others who have overcome difficulties to become successful. 

## Remember:
- Recognize avoidance
-- Donâ€™t distract yourself when difficulty arises. Break down problems and solve them bit by bit
- Maintain effort
-- Consider the negative side effects of taking the easy way out. Remember that taking on each challenge leads to personal growth.
- Embrace criticisms 
-- Reflect on your own performance and look for areas to improve. Set goals to not repeat what went wrong.
