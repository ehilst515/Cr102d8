# Text in HTML
**Structural** mark up is the elements used to describe parts of the page, such as body and headings. **Semantic** markup provides extra information, such as where emphasis should be in a sentence. **White space** is ignored, so tags must be used for breaks.

Element | Tag
------------ | -------------
Paragraphs |`<p>` Paragraphs `</p>`
**Bold**| `<b>` Bold `</b>`
*Italics* | `<i>` Italics `</i>`
Superscript<sup>3</sup> | `<sup>`3`</sup>`
Subscript<sub>4</sub> | `<sub>`4`</sub>`
Line <br>breaks | Line`<br>`breaks
Horizontal <hr /> Breaks | Horizontal`<hr />`Breaks
<strong>Strong</strong> | `<strong>`Strong`</strong>` 
<em>Emphasis</em> | `<em>`Emphasis`</em>`

# Design web pages with CSS
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheet allows a coder to change the looks of HTML elements. Each element has an invisible box around it, and CSS can change the appearance of what's in the box. Each ancestor, child, and sibling within HTML code can be changed with different CSS rules. For example, we can change set the font color of a header, `<h1>`, differently from the paragraph, `<p>`, within the same body.

In the code below, `p` is the selector and everything after is called the declaration, which modifies how things appear on the web page. Notice how the declaration opens and closes with `{}`, and each line ends with `;`.

```
p {
    font-family: Arial;
    color: blue;
}
```
*Our paragraphs all have the font-family Arial and blue text.*

In this code, we are targeting a class callout out as `id = answers` within an element

```
.answers {
    background-color: green;
}
```

*Anything with the class id `answers` has a green background.*

# JavaScript

#### JavaScript Basics

We previously learned that HTML provides the framework of a website, and using CSS provides the ability to change how a website is presented. The final piece of the website puzzle is **JavaScript**, which is a language commonly used to make things that can be interacted with and that can change the way a webpage behaves. For example, the JavaScript code below can greet a visitor different ways depending on the time of day:

```
var today = new Date();
var hourNow = today.getHours();
var greeting;

if (hourNow > 18) {
    greeting = 'Good evening!';
}   else if (hourNow > 12){
    greeting = 'Good afternoon!';
}   else if (hourNow > 0) {
    greeting = 'Good morning!';
}   else {
    greeting = 'Welcome!';
}

document.write('<h3>' + greeting + '</h3>');

```

A .js file can be made and used as the source within an HTML file using:

```
<script src="(directorylocation/filename.js)"></script>
```

Correctly placing this code will make the properly timed greeting work! 

*Note that JavaScript is written with `OBJECT.METHOD`. Each `OBJECT` has certain **members** it can access, and the period between the `OBJECT` and `METHOD` is called "member operator".*

#### Operations and Loops in JavaScript

### Operators
##### *Result into a Boolean: `true` or`false`*

Operator | Operation | Example | Result
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------
`==` |is equal to | `4 = 3` | `False`
`!=` | is not equal to | `4 = 3` | `True`
`===` | strict equals to | `'4'=== 4` <br> `'4' === '4'`| `False` <br> `True`
`!==`| strict not equals to| `'4'=== 4` <br> `'4' === '4'`| `True` <br> `False`
`>` | greater than| `4 > 3`|  `True`
`<` | less than | `4 > 3` | `False`
`&&` | logical and | `((4>3)&&(4<5))`|`true`
`||` | logical or | `((4>3)||(4>100))`| `true`
`!`| logical not | `!(4>10)`| `true`

### Loops keep Looping
##### *Until rules are met for them to stop*

**Loops** check for logic, and repeat lines of code until certain rules are met. These are the different loops:

- `for`; used when an array is needed to store information
- `while`; used when calculations need to be repeated
