# JS Object Literals; The DOM

## JS Object Literals

Objects have properties, such as values to describe or name something, and methods. Methods are functions inside of objects when coding in JavaScript. Object values can be:
- `string`
- `number`
- `Boolean`
- `array`

```
var hotel = new Object()

hotel.name = 'Park'
```
In this example, `hotel` is an object `name` is the property name, and `Park` is the property value.

## The DOM
Dom stands for "Document Object Model." It is the tree of stored memory for a website. 

- HTML
    - head
        - meta
        - title
        - link
    - body
        - header
            - h1
            - nav
        - main
            - h2
            - img
            - ul
                - li
                - li
                - li
            - p
        - footer
            - address
            - p

Each point in this tree is called a *node*.
- **Element node**: the structure of an HTML page; `h1`, `body`, `ul`, etc. 
- **Attribute node**: not children; `class = ''`, `id = ''`, `class = ''`
- **Text node**: contain the text of the page, cannot have children; `p`, `li`, `address`, etc.

We can target each node with different methods in CSS, previously covered in this learning journal. Similarly, each node can be accessed in JS. We can *update* the text of a node, and *add* or *remove* nodes. We can target elements using `.getElementById()` or `.getAttribute()`.

**XSS**, cross-site scripting, is an attack where someone uses scripts to abuse the content of a website. An attacker can insert scripts using **untrusted data**, which is anything a website owner does not have total control over, or by finding data in the DOM. We should use `textContent` or `innerText` instead of `innerHTML` to reduce risks from XSS.
