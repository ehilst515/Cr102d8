### Text Editors
Text editors allow users what they sound like; they help edit text. However, not all text editors are made the same. The most basic and widely-known text editor is Notepad. It has none of the “bells and whistles” that more complex text editors have: syntax highlighting, themes and no extensions. 

* Highlighting: syntax becomes highlighted in different colors to easily identify different elements and syntax errors

* Themes: the background and text colors can be customized to for preference and to reduce eye strain

* Extensions: plug-ins that give the text editors abilities for users to have more automation 

*Software developers need to be thoughtful about what text editor to use by considering what preferences they have for features.* 

* The Command Line: where code is typed in; the terminal 

* Basic Navigation:  absolute and relative paths are used to navigate, and “~”, is for shortcuts and ”.” , ”..” are used for references 

* About Files: everything is a file, and are found through paths
