### Text Editors
Text editors allow users what they sound like; they help edit text. However, not all text editors are made the same. The most basic and widely-known text editor is Notepad. It has none of the “bells and whistles” that more complex text editors have: syntax highlighting, themes and no extensions. 

* Highlighting: syntax becomes highlighted in different colors to easily identify different elements and syntax errors

* Themes: the background and text colors can be customized to for preference and to reduce eye strain

* Extensions: plug-ins that give the text editors abilities for users to have more automation 

* Software developers need to be thoughtful about what text editor to use by considering what preferences they have for features.
